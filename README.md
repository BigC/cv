I was responsible for leading a team of 20 backend developers and making core technology choices.
The first MVP was built on Django and [raises 30 million US dollars](https://icorating.com/ico/play2live/) in ICO (BTC, ETH-equivalent). 
The blockchain app was built on top of BitShares’ network and did not include an AI layer. 
The second MVP was built on Django, pure python and C/C++ technologies. 
We built a streaming service, artificial intelligence layer in C/C++, dozens of backend API's, and self-developed an API gateway using the JSON-RPC protocol.
